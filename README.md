# Welcome to Digital Sledgehammer

This tool is a simple Command Line tool (a bit similar to Windwos CMD), that doesn't really do much now.
When it starts to do more, I'll be sure to add some docs to the project (probably in `root/docs`)


## Use on Linux
To use it now, just copy the excecutable file in `bin/` to your `/usr/bin`, and then use the ds-start command in a terminal window.

## Use it on Windows
To use it now, go to `build/build-ds.bat` and follow the instructions there. Build the project, and then copy `build/ds-start.exe` file to whatever directory you like (maybe your `%PATH%`?), and then run it from a terminal. Don't ask me how to run it from a terminal, I don't know, because I have sense and use Linux (@canonical). If you are on either Linux or macOS, and you want to build for windows, go to the `build/build-ds.sh` and follow the instructions there.

## Use on macOS (If you're that kind of person)
To use it now, just copy the excecutable file in `bin/` to your `/usr/bin`, and then use the ds-start command in a terminal window.

<b>*Please note that this project builds using GCC (so you must have that in your %PATH% if you're on Windows), at -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror.*-</b>
