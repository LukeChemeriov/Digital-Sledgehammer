# Welcome to Digital Sledgehammer

This tool is a simple Command Line tool (a bit similar to Windwos CMD), that doesn't really do much now.
When it starts to do more, I'll be sure to add some docs to the project (probably in `root/docs`)

To use it now, though, just copy the excecutable file in `bin/` to your `/usr/bin` (Yes, I am planning to add Windows support), and then use the ds-start command in a terminal window.
